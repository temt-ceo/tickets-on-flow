  terms_of_use1: 'There are 6 billion people in the world.',
  terms_of_use2: 'The Internet is connected to the world, and it would be wonderful if we could do business using only our smartphones.',
  terms_of_use3: 'In reality, however, international money transfers are very time-consuming. In addition, the fees for international money transfers can sometimes be as high as 30%.',
  terms_of_use4: 'That\'s where Cryptocurrency comes in. It is a currency that has the same value all over the world and can be moved over the Internet.',
  terms_of_use5: 'If you could start a business with just a phone and earn cryptocurrency, people all over the world could work to earn a currency that has a common value all over the world.',
  terms_of_use6: 'It doesn\'t have to be a business. It can be a tip or a donation. Also it can be crowdfunding.',
  terms_of_use7: 'If currency could be easily passed over the Internet, people in need for irrational reasons around the world could appeal to the world to obtain a currency of common value in return for their skills.',
  terms_of_use8: 'Cryptocurrency spread quickly in the financial industry. This is because everyone in the financial industry was convinced of the potential power of cryptocurrency.',
  terms_of_use9: 'This app was created to let people know that Cryptocurrency has such wonderful qualities that they can start a business around the world with a single smartphone to obtain a currency of equal value over the world. FLOW coin, which does not cost gas, has a great potential to play a role in this.',
  terms_of_use10: 'However, there are also many scams. You are giving money to someone somewhere in the world.',
  terms_of_use11: 'Therefore, this application cannot accept large sums of money. However, I think we all know how great crowdfunding is at raising funds from all over the world.',
  terms_of_use12: 'When your charm and skills are recognized around the world, even for a small amount, you can do brilliant business with people all over the world with just one phone.',
  terms_of_use13: 'This application allows anyone in the world who wants to make money to do so with just a few clicks, using only a smartphone or laptop.',
  terms_of_use14: 'The only cost to create a ticket is 0.5 FLOW. That\'s all it takes to create a ticket for a lifetime and sell that ticket in exchange for your attraction.',
  terms_of_use15: 'When the ticket is used, you will instantly have cryptocurrency in your wallet.',
  terms_of_use16: 'Commission? It costs a little. 2.5%. But if you want to crowdfund using only your smartphone, consider whether this fee is high.',
  terms_of_use17: 'Hello, Here\'s a description of the Tickets service!',
  terms_of_use18: 'Introduction',
  terms_of_use19: 'Imagine, now you have a smartphone.',
  terms_of_use20: 'And you have been touching social networking sites ever since you were a little girl (or boy).',
  terms_of_use21: 'You shop with your smartphone, you search with your smartphone, and you work with your smartphone.',
  terms_of_use22: 'Have you ever received a job referral regarding something you posted?',
  terms_of_use23: 'So, have you ever wanted to take it a step further and earn an income from your smartphone?',
  terms_of_use24: 'What if you could do that easily?',
  terms_of_use25: 'Have you ever made money?',
  terms_of_use26: 'I believe it is the currency of your country.',
  terms_of_use27: 'However, some people on the Internet do not know your country\'s currency.',
  terms_of_use28: 'That is an obstacle when working on the Internet. What if there was a currency that everyone knew? Now that you are here, you know the currency called FLOW.',
  terms_of_use29: 'In the next section, I will teach how to earn FLOW coins.',
  terms_of_use30: 'Do you have any special skills? Or are you familiar with certain knowledge?',
  terms_of_use31: 'Now it is very easy to create a website on the Internet.',
  terms_of_use32: 'With this system, you can create your original webpage with your favorite URL in just 3 taps.',
  terms_of_use33: 'The XXXXX part can be any URL you like.',
  terms_of_use34: 'This website is a great way to showcase your skills and earn money. This is because the website has the ability to sell tickets to get into the private space that you offer.',
  terms_of_use35: 'To do this, you can sell tickets. But selling on the internet is very difficult. The country and currency you are dealing with might be different, and even if you have a QR code, how do you get the ticket to the person you are dealing with? That\'s a lot of work, isn\'t it? If you manage it all on the blockchain, you would have an ideal job where no one is exploited in the middle.',
  terms_of_use36: 'Now, social networking sites are gradually expanding the system to support your work.',
  terms_of_use37: 'Youtube and TikTok already have mechanisms for contributors to earn money, and others support the sale of goods.',
  terms_of_use38: 'However, it is limited to video only. What if you do not want anyone to see your videos? For example, let\'s say you are a native English speaker and you want to open an English conversation class. It doesn\'t make sense to just stream them on YouTube; you would need to teach them one-to-one using a tool such as Zoom.',
  terms_of_use39: 'What can only this service do?',
  terms_of_use40: 'About Cost',
  terms_of_use41: 'The cost to create a website is 0.3FLOW.',
  terms_of_use42: 'But the information is recorded in the blockchain and the website created can be used forever.',
  terms_of_use43: 'Why? This website uses only blockchain technology. It will exist as long as blockchain exists.',
  terms_of_use44: 'About the Mechanism',
  terms_of_use45: 'The advantage of blockchain is that the data is stored forever. It can be acquired by anyone.',
  terms_of_use46: 'That means you can also use it to store your sales data. This data cannot be tampered with by anyone.',
  terms_of_use47: 'The bank is out of the picture, so there are almost no fees. (We charge a small fee.)',
  terms_of_use48: 'Suppose you want to open a store on the Internet.',
  terms_of_use49: 'There are numerous websites on the Internet, and it is extremely difficult for people to find you through searches.',
  terms_of_use50: 'However, there are many people who are good at social networking.',
  terms_of_use51: 'If you are a celebrity and want to throw a party on Zoom, Teams, Youtube, or teach information that only you know, you can use social networking sites to get the word out. But isn\'t it a little harder to collect money?',
  terms_of_use52: 'The solution is to register everyone who joins there on the blockchain.',
  terms_of_use53: 'The registered people would need to send money to participate in your business.',
  terms_of_use54: 'Then you can focus on your own work.',
  terms_of_use55: 'With Ethereum Blockchain, this complex process may be impossible to create quickly.',
  terms_of_use56: 'But with Flow Blockchain, we can create it immediately.',
  terms_of_use57: 'You can start your business on social networking sites tomorrow.',
  terms_of_use58: 'What can this service do?',
  terms_of_use59: 'You can use either prepayment or deferred payment as your means of income.',
  terms_of_use60: 'If you prefer to pay in advance, you can use the Ticket service; if you prefer to pay later, you can use the Crowdfunding service.',
  terms_of_use61: 'You can change your website as you wish. It is your homepage.',
  terms_of_use62: 'If you want to change your homepage, please tell us that you want to change it from the Telegram icon in the upper left corner. The cost will be taken via Crowdfunding.',
  terms_of_use63: 'As I mentioned earlier, Flow Blockchain is a great blockchain. It costs very little gas fee, is earth friendly, fast, and very secure.',
  terms_of_use64: 'Earning FLOW now will be a great investment in the future.',
  terms_of_use65: 'Use this website to earn FLOW.',
  terms_of_use66: 'No more QR codes to collect money. There is also a refund function and CSV output function, you know?',
